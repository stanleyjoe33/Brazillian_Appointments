    "> **Tip**: In this section of the report, provide a brief introduction to the dataset you've selected/downloaded for analysis. Read through the description available on the homepage-links present [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTlVmknRRnfy_4eTrjw5hYGaiQim5ctr9naaRd4V9du2B5bxpd8FEH3KtDgp8qVekw7Cj1GLk1IXdZi/pub?embedded=True). List all column names in each table, and their significance. In case of multiple tables, describe the relationship between tables.\n",

    "In this project we would be analyzing appointment schedule records to show how certain recorded patient information like Age, Alcholic habits, Gender among a few others did or did not have significant relationships with the probabilty of a patient showing up for his or her appointment.  \n",
    "This particular dataset consists of information of about 100k medical appointments in Brazil. The main focus of the dataset is whether the patients showed up for their appointments or not. The dataset consists of 14 columns:\n",

    "\n",
    "**5- AppointmentDay:** The day at which the patient should show up for his appointment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6- Age:** The age of each patient.\n",

    "### Questions for Analysis\n",
    ">**Tip**: Clearly state one or more questions that you plan on exploring over the course of the report. You will address these questions in the **data analysis** and **conclusion** sections. Try to build your report around the analysis of at least one dependent variable and three independent variables. If you're not sure what questions to ask, then make sure you familiarize yourself with the dataset, its variables and the dataset context for ideas of what to explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip**: Once you start coding, use NumPy arrays, Pandas Series, and DataFrames where appropriate rather than Python lists and dictionaries. Also, **use good coding practices**, such as, define and use functions to avoid repetitive code. Use appropriate comments within the code cells, explanation in the mark-down cells, and meaningful variable names. \n",

    "Q1. Could gender and age be associated with showing up or not?\n",

    "\n",
    "Q3. Were certain Locations and day(s) of the week associated with significantley higher or lower showup counts?\n",

These don't have to be organized, but make sure you use enough comments to understand the purpose of each code cell. Then, after you're done with your analysis, create a duplicate notebook where you will trim the excess and organize your steps so that you have a flowing, cohesive report."
